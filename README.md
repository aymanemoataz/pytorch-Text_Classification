# pytorch-Text_Classification

## Dataset : UCC - Unhealthy comments corpus :

The goal of this practical project is to implement state-of-the-art NLP models in pytorch to perform multi-label text classification on the high-quality UCC dataset. This dataset was published in 2020 in the paper [Six Attributes of Unhealthy Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07410). 
The dataset now contains over 80,000 healthy and unhealthy comments. In addition to the binary labels, it also captures 6 unhealthy sub-attributes, such as (1) hostile, (2) insulting and trolling, (3) dismissive .... (6) unfair generalization. For some of these attributes, this was the first large publicly available dataset that captured them.
